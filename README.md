## Description
I created this project to organize information about myself, my knowledge, and some of my previous websites. The design is inspired by Google Play and Harvard pages.

## What I learned 
To improve my CSS management, I used SASS for the first time, which turned out to be very useful: Dividing values into variables made it easy to find their location, and having related properties, such as font, in a specific place instead of being directly put inside a class helped a lot. 
By using SASS, I learned about folder structure, partials, nesting, variables, and mixins. Although I didn't delve into SASS functions, I plan to explore them in the future. 

## How to use
Overall, the app offers a good user experience. Feel free to explore it!
